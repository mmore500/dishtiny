# Glossary

## Actuator

An output that a cell's genetic program can control to interact with the environment.

## Artifact

Serialized simulation objects, like a genome or a population.

## Cardinal

The virtual CPU and hardware a cell uses to manage environmental and agent-agent interactions with respect to a particular neighboring cell.
Each cell has one cardinal per neighboring cell, four in total on the two-dimensional toroidal grid.
The term cardinal is used in the sense of "cardinal directions."

## Cell

The smallest reproducing element of the simulation.
Occupies a single tile on the two-dimensional toroidal grid.
Contains a genome, which is run in parallel on each virtual CPU within the cell.

## Configuration

Refers to settings that may be adjusted run-time (as opposed to compile-time).
Can be controlled by command-line flag, URL query parameters, or configuration file (`.cfg`).

## Configpack

A bundled set of configuration (run-time settings) and specs (compile-time settings).
Corresponds to an experimental treatment.
Deployed as a downloadable zip archive.

## Control Competition

A fitness competition between a strain and an identical copy of itself, used as a statistical control.

## Critical Site

An instruction in a genome's program critical to fitness.
Specifically, consider a variant is created where that site is disabled.
If the site is critical, the variant would perform significantly worse in fitness competition against its wild-type counterpart.

## Doubling Time Assay

A test used to estimate fitness  where a single strain is seeded into a contiguous fourth of the toroidal grid and the population growth rate is monitored until it fills half of the toroidal grid or a timeout is reached.

## Event

A condition that can trigger execution of a genome module in a particular cardinal.
The simulation monitors whether the condition is fulfilled.
When the condition is fulfilled, a corresponding tag is dispatched to the cardinal's virtual CPU.
If the event tag matches with a tag identifying a genome module, execution of that genome module is triggered.

## Event Library

The set of supported events that are dispatched by the simulation.

## Extrospective State

The readable state of a neighboring cell's cardinal.
This state is available for a cell to read from its neighbor on a best-effort basis.
This state is also used by the simulation to dispatch certain events.

## Fitness

A genome's reproductive success.

## Fitness Competition

A test used to compare the relative fitness of two strains.
The two-dimensional toroidal grid is seeded with equal copy counts of two strains, intermixed.
The simulation is run with mutation disabled for a fixed amount of time.
At the end of a fitness competition,
Replicate measurements allow for statistical detection of fitness differences between the strains.

## Fitness Complexity

The number of critical sites in a genome.

## Fitness Tournament

A set of fitness competitions among strains from different series, used to estimate fitness of the strains relative to one another.
Competitions are conducted so that each strain participates in fitness competitions with a unique, arbitrarily chosen set of twenty other strains.
Fitness of a focal strain can be estimated in terms of mean fitness in its competitions or the number of competitions won.

## Fitness-Noncritical Nopout Morph

A morph in which all instructions that are not critical sites are nopped out.

## Genome

Consists of a genetic program and an array of tags to identify events.
Also contains bookkeeping information about elapsed mutations and elapsed updates.

# Inter Messages

Messages that are transmitted between cells.
These messages contain a tag used to induce computation in the target virtual CPU and may also contain additional data.

# Intra Messages

Messages that are transmitted between cardinals within a cell.
These messages contain a tag used to induce computation in the target virtual CPU and may also contain additional data.

## Introspective State

State describing a cardinal's environmental conditions that can be read, but not written, by the cardinal's virtual CPU.

## Module

A sequence of virtual CPU instructions in a program that is identified by a tag so that it may be triggered by an event or a message.

## Morph

A genome derived from a source strain by a set of many modifications.
For example, we might construct a morph in which *all* messaging instructions were nopped out.
As opposed to a variant, in which a small number of explicitly-named changes are applied to a genome.

## Mutation Event

An event during cellular reproduction in which mutations are applied to the genome inherited by the daughter cell.
Mutations applied include insertions, deletions, and point mutations.

## Nop Instruction

A virtual CPU instruction that, when executed, performs no action.
(Except possibly advancing the random number generator engine, depending on configuration.)

## Nopout

Replacing an instruction in a program with a Nop instruction.
This Nop instruction is configured so that it advances the random number generator engine identically to the original instruction.

## Op Instruction

An instruction that is not a nop instruction.

## Operation

The action that an instruction in a genetic program causes the virtual CPU to take.
For example, a Read State operation or a Send Message operation.

## Peripheral

A struct passed to operation functions in addition to hardware state.
Operation functions can read from or write to this struct.
Each virtual CPU has its own peripheral instance, which is passed to all operation that the virtual CPU executes.
All interactions between a virtual CPU and other agents/the environment are mediated through the virtual CPU's peripheral.
Equivalent of a "trait" in vanilla SignalGP.

## Phenotype

The set of outwardly-observable traits of a biological organism.
Essentially, simulation state outside of the virtual CPU hardware.

## Phenotype Complexity

The number of op instructions in the strain's phenotype-equivalent nopout morph.

## Phenotype Differentiation

A test used to determine if two strains are phenotypically equivalent.
The strains are run in independent simulations with identical initial random number generator state.
These simulations are advanced step-by-step for a fixed number of updates.
If resource concentrations remain identical between the simulations throughout the computed updates, the genomes are consider phenotypically equivalent.
Otherwise, they are considered phenotypically differentiated.

## Phenotype-Equivalent Nopout Morph

A genome morph with all instructions that can be nopped out while maintaining phenotypic equivalence are nopped out.
This genome is generated using a "jenga" procedure in which instructions that do not cause phenotypic divergence are sequentially nopped out until no more instructions can be nopped out without causing phenotypic divergence.
This guarantees that the phenotype-equivalent nopout morph is exactly phenotypically equivalent to its source strain.

(This "jenga" procedure contrasts with an older "battleship" procedure in which all instructions were independently tested for phenotypic divergence under nopout.
Under this procedure, the resulting genome was not guaranteed to be phenotypically identical to the source strain due to epistatic effects.)

## Readable State

All cardinal state that the virtual CPU can read, including writable state and introspective state.
Readable state is hosted within the cardinal's peripheral.

## SignalGP

The virtual hardware framework that powers cardinal's virtual CPUs.
This hardware framework allows genetic programs to harness the event-driven computing paradigm.
This project uses a variant of "vanilla" SignalGP called signalgp-lite.

## Self-send Perturbation

An experimental condition in which a subset of cells are induced to deliver messages (either intra or inter) back to the sending cardinal rather than to the original target.
Used to assess the impact of messaging on fitness.

## Sensor

An input that a cell's genetic program can read to observe environmental state.

## Service

A struct with member functions that determine whether a task should be performed on a particular cell and how to perform that task to update simulation state for that single cell.
A spec type specifies an ordered list of services to run at each update.

## Spec

A type specifying compile-time configuration options.
Most simulation methods and objects are templated on this type.
Which spec to compile with can be specified by passing `-CXXFLAGS="-DDISH2_SPEC=dish2::Spec_myspec` to the `make` command.

## State Exchange Perturbation

An experimental condition in which a subset of cells are manipulated so that their virtual CPU's perceive inputs meant for another cell or have output overwritten by those created by another cell.
Used to test whether the spatial distribution of certain inputs or outputs affects fitness.

## State Rotate Perturbation

An experimental condition in which a subset of cells are manipulated so that their virtual CPU's perceive inputs meant for another cardinal within the cell or have output overwritten by those created by another cardinal within the cell.
Used to test whether the directionality of certain inputs or outputs affects fitness.

## Tag

A bitstring used to match messages and events with program modules.

## Threadlocal Service

A struct with member functions that determine whether a task should be performed on a thread's population of cells and how to perform that task to update simulation state on a thread's population of cells.
A spec type specifies an ordered list of threadlocal services to run at each update.

## Variant

A genome derived from a source strain by a single modification.
For example, nopping out a particular instruction.
As opposed to a morph, where a larger set of changes are applied to a genome.

## Wildtype Morph

A genome harvested from an evolutionary experiment exactly as evolved, with no modifications.

## Writable State

All cardinal state that the virtual CPU can write, including actuator state and nop state.
Writable state is hosted within the cardinal's peripheral.

   the rows of R solving for the components of x backwards.  For example, the
   final row in R gives the equation

     r_{l,l} x_l = v_l

   the equation

     r_(l-1,l-1} x_{l-1} + r_{l-1,l} x_{l} = v_l

   which can be solved by substituting in the value of x_l already found, and
   then solving the resulting equation for x_{l-1}.  Continuing in this way
   solves the entire system.

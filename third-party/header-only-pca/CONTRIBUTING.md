- Submitting new code
- Writing documentation

## Reporting Bugs

To report bugs, please [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/rodsan0/header-only-pca/issues)
clearly stating the observed (buggy) behavior (screenshots are encouraged), the desired behavior,
which operating system and compiler you're using (including version), and any additional information that might
help us fix the bug. If possible, please provide a minimum example that reproduces the bug.

## Fixing Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

## Write Documentation

Header-Only PCA could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Header-Only PCA docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

## Requesting features

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

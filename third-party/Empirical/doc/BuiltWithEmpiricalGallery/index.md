- [Choose Your Words!](https://devosoft.github.io/dynamic-word/)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/devosoft/dynamic-word)

  - A pedagogical example of dynamic programming.

- [circle replicators with simple physics
    example](https://lalejini.com/my_empirical_examples/simple_physics_example/web/example.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/amlalejini/my_empirical_examples/tree/master/simple_physics_example)

  - interactive web demo of Empirical\'s circle physics with
        \'circle organisms\' eating nutritious \'circle food\' in order
        to self-replicate
  - WARNING: Built using a 2017 version of Empirical; source may be
        out of date with current version of Empirical.

- [dishtiny web viewer](https://mmore500.github.io/dishtiny)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/mmore500/dishtiny)

  - interactive web demo of an artificial life platform built to
        study major transitions in evolution

- [ecology of evolutionary
    computation](https://emilydolson.github.io/ecology_of_evolutionary_computation/web/interaction_networks.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/emilydolson/ecology_of_evolutionary_computation)

  - interactive exploration of interaction networks in evolutionary
        computation under different selection schemes

- [Evoke](https://devosoft.github.io/Evoke)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/devosoft/Evoke)

  - evolving cells in a 2D physics environment that can link
        together like Snowflake Yeast

- [kmeans clustering
    example](https://lalejini.com/my_empirical_examples/KMeansClusteringExample/web/kmeans_clustering.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/amlalejini/my_empirical_examples/tree/master/KMeansClusteringExample)

  - interactive kmeans clustering demonstration

- [spatial lineage
    visualization](https://emilydolson.github.io/visualizations/spatial_lineage/LineageViz.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/emilydolson/visualizations/)

  - a phylogeny color-coded by each individual\'s position in the
        world, demonstrating the spatial dynamics of an evolving
        population

- [Model of cancer evolution on an oxygen
    gradient](http://emilydolson.github.io/memic_model/web/memic_model.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/emilydolson/memic_model/)

  - A companion model to a series of wet lab experiments on cancer
        evolution in spatially heterogenous environments

- [Model of evolution with varying genomic
    instability](https://emilydolson.github.io/genomic_stability_model/web/genomic_stability_model.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/emilydolson/genomic_stability_model/)

  - This model was built in a day during the 2019 \[IMO
        workshop\](<http://psoc.moffitt.org/education/psoc-annual-workshop/>)
        to identify the parameter ranges under which it might be
        possible to treat cancer by altering genomic stability.

- [A.A.G.O.S.](https://lalejini.com/Aagos/web/Aagos.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/amlalejini/Aagos/)

  - An interactive artificial life model that demonstrates (1) how
        changing environments can promote the evolution of modular
        genetic architectures and (2) how high mutation rates can
        promote the evolution of more compact architectures (more
        goverlapping genes).

- [Symbulation](https://anyaevostinar.github.io/SymbulationEmp/web/symbulation.html)
    [\[source\]](https://github.com/anyaevostinar/SymbulationEmp)

  - An interactive artificial life model focused on the evolution of
        symbiosis between parasitism to mutualism. Also features a game
        to recreate major results from published work.

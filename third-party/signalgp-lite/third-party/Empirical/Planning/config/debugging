Since some variables are pre-defined and others are only used in the config file as part of the
logic, it won't always be clear when settings are intended vs. other types of variables.

Important debugging options might be:
* Warn if a known setting is not touched in the file.
* Warn if a non-setting variable is created, but never used.

(each type of warning can be suppressed, either on the command line or in the settings file.)

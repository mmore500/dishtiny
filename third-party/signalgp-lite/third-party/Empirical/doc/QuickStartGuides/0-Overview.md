# Overview

The goal of Empirical is to simplify the development of efficient,
reliable, and accessible scientific software.

We have several quick-start guides for different portions of the code.

Getting started: - Using specific header files is simple, just
`#include` them into your own project. We recommend adding your
`Empirical/include/emp/` folder to the include directories for your C++
compiler (usually with the `-I` option). - To use the web features in
Empirical, you must first install the emscripten compiler, which can be
slightly more complicated. \* Our [Hello World Guide](1-HelloWorld)
will help you get compiling with Empirical, natively and for web.

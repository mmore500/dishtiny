- Submitting new code
- Writing documentation

## Reporting Bugs

To report bugs, please [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/mmore500/signalgp-lite/issues)
clearly stating the observed (buggy) behavior (screenshots are encouraged), the desired behavior,
which operating system and compiler you're using (including version), and any additional information that might
help us fix the bug. If possible, please provide a minimum example that reproduces the bug.

## Fixing Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

## Write Documentation

SignalGP Lite could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official SignalGP Lite docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

## Requesting features

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/mmore500/signalgp-lite/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

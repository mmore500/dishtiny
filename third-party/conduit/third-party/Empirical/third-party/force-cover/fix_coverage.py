"""
fix_coverage.py is a script for modifying C++ coverage reports to
mark uninstantiated templates as executable regions missing coverage.

Usage: ./fix_coverage.py [coverage_report_file]

Assumes that coverage file has the format:
[source_line_number] | [execution_count]| [code]

./force_coverage must have been run on the source code before it was
compiled in order for this to work.
